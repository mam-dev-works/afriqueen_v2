**FILTERED**

The filters are the same in the LIST and MATCH pages (the filter applies to both pages; if I modify it in LIST, it also modifies it in MATCH).

For the other pages (EVENT, STORY, MESSAGING, ACTIVITY) the filters are independent (specific to each page)

**NOTIFICATION**

In addition to visual notifications on the buttons (numbers on the buttons in/within MESSAGING and/or ACTIVITY when the user receives views, messages, like requests, etc. ), there are informational notifications.

Information notifications will arrive on a NOTIFICATIONS page, where we will find notifications generated by the administrator (warnings/bans, identity verification results, dispute results, results of adding a passion/profession) and notifications generated by users based on event participation results

**PARTICIPATION**

Accepted or declined participation in an event generates an information notification, containing the result (accepted or declined) as well as a link to the details of the event concerned + a link to the open discussion (in case of acceptance)

Accepted participation in an event creates a discussion in MESSAGING/EVENT (in "they participated" if I accepted participation in my event, or in "I participated" if my participation in another user's event was accepted).

In the discussion created, we find the title and date of the event in question, as well as a link to the details of the event .

Creating the discussion generates a visual notification (number) on the MESSAGING/EVENT buttons (they participated or I participated)

Participation in an accepted or declined event disappears from ACTIVITY/EVENT (they participated or I participated)

If I click the "participate" button for an event I've already attended and which has been accepted, it opens the discussion I created (MESSAGING/EVENT/I ATTENDED).

If participation in an event is pending (awaiting acceptance or rejection) or if participation has already been rejected, the "participate" button for the event in question changes color and is "locked".
If you try to submit another entry to this event, an information window will open (you can no longer submit entries to this event).

**MESSAGING**

If I click on the message button (from anywhere, match, list, story, profile details) of a user who liked me (from anywhere, match, list, story, profile details) but who did not send me a message, this creates a conversation in MESSAGING/MESSAGES (creating a visual notification in the messages of the user concerned)

If I click on the message button of a user who has sent me a request (request in progress, awaiting acceptance or refusal), this opens the details of the current request (MESSAGING/REQUEST).

If I click on the message button of a user with whom I have a discussion (request accepted), it opens the details of the discussion (MESSAGING/MESSAGE).

If I click on the message button of a user who has not liked or sent me a message, this creates a request (MESSAGING/REQUEST) (create a visual notification in messaging and request for the user concerned)

**STORY**

In STORY, clicking on a story opens "story details".

Opening a "detail story" creates a visual notification (number) in ACTIVITY/STORY/VIEWED
(Opening profile details from STORY creates a visual notification in ACTIVITY/SEEN/ON ME SEEN, but not in STORY/SEEN)

Liking a story (from STORY or story details) creates a visual notification (number) in ACTIVITY/STORY/LIKE

**EVENT**

Events are categorized by:

The ELITES events first, then the PREMIMU events
then by date of the event (from the closest date to the furthest)
then by distance (from closest to furthest in km)

Events are only shown once.

There is the option to view past events using a "previous" button (or swipe down) (it remains to be seen if this previous function is cumbersome for the application to manage, including in MATCH and STORY; if so, we can determine a maximum number of previous events).
