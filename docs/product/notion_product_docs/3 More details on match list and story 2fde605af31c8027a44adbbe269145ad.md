# 3. More details on match list and story

The ARCHIVE
category corresponds to the user profile put in ARCHIVE from everywhere -the RED LIST category (in the red list menu) corresponds to the profile that the user has blocked (from the block or report and block button, everywhere) be careful, it does not show users blocked by the filters I
want to block,

users blocked by filters remain in their respective categories but are made invisible there (for the user only in the I WANT TO SEE filters, for the user and the profiles concerned in the I WANT TO
BLOCK filter)

the FAVORITES category (is not a separate category, the profile is in a category + in FAVORITES) corresponds to the profile that the user has put in FAVORITES (from everywhere) a profile can be
found both in FAVORITES and in LIKE, or both in FAVORITES and ARCHIVE or both in FAVORITES and NEW but never only in the FAVORITES category. The user is limited to a maximum of 50 favorites (if there is no more space in the favorites when the user tries to put a profile in favorites, this opens an information window "you have reached the favorites limit, you can free up space from your favorites" with a link to LIST/FAVORITES (back button takes you back to the previous page).

LINK TO ACTION following a blockage (example no more profile, link to filter or no more space in favorites, link to favorites) in the destination pages from these links, a "back" button appears and allows
the user to return (before or during the necessary corrective action) to where he was before being blocked, (and having to take action to unblock himself). After performing the action necessary to unblock him, the user automatically returns to where he was before being blocked (without needing to click back)

The PROFILE THUMBNAILS (from all pages) must allow the user to scroll through the different profile photos (we will integrate this into the layout)

MATCH only displays profiles in the NEW category
A category change action (LIKE ARCHIVE RED LIST) is mandatory to see the next profile if there are no more
profiles, information message "no more profiles available corresponding to your criteria + button to filter" (swiping down allows you to review the profiles already processed)
A profile that I liked and that liked me (from everywhere) created (in addition to the respective likes in activity) a match in ACTIVITY / LIKE / MATCH

LIST allows you to display profiles from different categories (taking filters into account). If filtered on the NEW category, the user's actions (LIKE, ARCHIVE) automatically classify the profile (take it out of NEW and put it in the category chosen by the user) it will be visible in its category (example a liked profile disappears from NEW and appears in LIKE) (we will create a visual of the "disappearance" of the profiles) if no more profiles (bottom of list) message "no more profiles
corresponding to your search" + button to filter

STORY presents stories from all profile categories (according to the filters selected by the user). The stories are only presented once (previous , if no more stories, message “no more stories available corresponding to your search” + button to filter” (swipe down to review stories)

A like made from the story (like button on the story) creates a like in ACTIVITY / STORY / LIKE for the recipient (the profile that published the story) and does not create any activity on the user side (who
liked the story) be careful the story like is not the same as a profile like.

Opening the PROFILE DETAIL from the story creates a view in ACTIVITY / SEEN / I SEEN for the user who performs the action, and in ACTIVITY / SEEN / I SEEN IT for the recipient (the profile
viewed) as well as a view in ACTIVITY / STORY / SEEN for the recipient (the profile viewed who published the story)

LIST allows you to see, according to the filters, all profiles (except red list and other countries)
